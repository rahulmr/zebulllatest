            <span class="titleText">Introduction</span><br><br>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Mobull Rest based web services are build on top of Thomson
                Reuters (Omnesys) REST API which connects to their NEST based OMS and RMS systems. This
                acts as a wrapper to simplify the complex nature of the original API. Mobull
                REST provides an easy way to place orders, view order book, watch positions and view funds
                and balances.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Mobull is built as a complete REST based platform and all
                input and output parameters are based on JSON unless stated otherwise. The service calls
                are platform independent and the examples given are Javascript based (AJAX)
                calls.</p>
            <p style="text-align: justify;">Each API call is structured as below</p><br>
            <ul style="font-style: italic;">
                <li>-URL to be called</li>
                <li>-Input Parameters with example JSON set</li>
                <li>-Response from server with all possible keys</li>
                <li>-Error messages</li>
                <li>-Sample JS programs (Optional)</li>
            </ul>
            <span class="Text">BASE URL</span><br><br>
            <p>The BASE URL is the common url used as prefix for all API call.</p>
            <pre>
            <p>Base URL : https://www.zebull.in/rest/MobullService/</p>
        </pre>
        <span class="Text">GENERATE API KEY</span><br><br>
        <li>User should first login through zebull web application.</li><br>
        <li>The API key can be generated through profile settings.</li><br>
        <li>The generated API key will be send to the user's registered mail.</li><br>
        <li>For authentication and authorization work flow, use that API key.</li><br>

            <span class="Text">AUTHENTICATION</span><br><br>
            <p>The following diagram depicts the usual API authentication flow.
                After getting the encryption key, user has to generate SHA-256 encrypted key to get
                User's Session Id. To do this, the user needs to encrypt the combintaion of User id,
                API key and encryption Key. Sending this to the API will provide the session id. Use the session id in
                authorization header for all further API calls. If there are any issues found, like unauthorized
                access or invalid session, user can re-generate session id by using the same set of process described
                above. </p>

          <span class="Text">AUTHORIZATION</span><br><br>
            <p>Every request except "authentication" should be appended with Authorization header having Bearer
                token as below</p>
            <pre>
                <p>Authorization: Bearer userId userSessionId</p>
    </pre>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>Bearer</td>
                    <td> Constant text. Adding this depends on the platform from which the user is going
                        to make the call</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>userId</td>
                    <td>User ID used for login</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>userSessionId</td>
                    <td>User Session ID which will be received upon successful API authentication</td>
                </tr>
            </table><br>
            <!--  <ul>
          <li>"Authorization: Bearer" - Constant text. Addig this depends on the platform from whih the user is going to make the call</li>
          <li>"ZEB100" - User ID used for login</li>
          <li>"8526253268" - User Session ID which will be received upon successful 2FA authentication </li>
